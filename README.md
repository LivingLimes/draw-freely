# Draw Freely

Draw Freely is a drawing game that aims to inspire creativity through fun drawing anything you like on a shared canvas while taking turns with other drawers.

There will be three modes:
- Time mode: Each drawer gets a turn of 10 seconds before it is the next drawer's turn to draw.
- Length mode: Each drawer gets to draw lines up to a certain length before it is the other person's turn.
- Single line mode: Each drawer can only draw one line before it is the other person's turn.
